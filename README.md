<!-- ## Features

### 1. Face Recognition

The Face Recognition module allows you to identify and analyze faces in images. Whether you're building a security system or creating fun applications, this feature provides a foundation for various face-related tasks.

### 2. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Unlock the potential of extracting text from images with the OCR module. From digitizing documents to automating data entry, this feature can be a game-changer for applications requiring text recognition.

### 3. Image Processing

The Image Processing capabilities of this project open up a world of creative possibilities. Apply filters, enhance colors, or manipulate images to suit your needs. The intuitive interface makes it easy to experiment and achieve the desired visual effects.

## Usage

1. **Face Recognition:**
   - Simply provide an image containing faces, and the system will identify and analyze them.
   - Explore additional features like emotion detection, age estimation, and gender classification for a comprehensive analysis.

2. **OCR:**
   - Supply an image with text, and the OCR module will extract and present the text data.
   - Utilize this feature for document scanning, automating data entry, or extracting information from images.

3. **Image Processing:**
   - Experiment with various filters, color adjustments, and transformations to enhance or stylize images.
   - Intuitive controls make it easy to visualize and apply changes in real-time.
